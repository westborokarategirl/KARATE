				About Me
			</h3>
				<p>
					I am Sakshi Gera, a junior at Westborough High School and a Girl Scout in Troop 30859. For five years, I have been taking karate at MetroWest Martial Arts and Wellness Center, and now am a third degree junior black belt.

			<h3>
				My Gold Award Project
			</h3>
				<p>
					As a Senior Girl Scout, I have been working towards my Gold Award: the highest level of achievement in Girl Scouting. This project takes on the issue of safety and self-defense in the community. I believe that everyone, no matter what their age, should know some form of self-defense. So, to address this, I am offering free monthly classes for kids and teens starting in December at the Westborough Public Library. These classes will each be 1 hour long, and there will be two different classes: one class will be for kids under 11, and the other will be for teens under 17.
