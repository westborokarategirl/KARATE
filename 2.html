			<h3>
			My karate classes will be held in the meeting room of the Westborough Public Library on Saturday mornings. The class for kids 11 and under will take place from 11:00-12:00, and the class for teens under 17 will be from 12:00-1:00. Parents will be allowed to stay and watch, or participate along with their children. Also, due to allergies, we will not provide snacks, but I strongly suggest that each participant bring their own snack and water bottle.
