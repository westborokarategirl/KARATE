				What is Karate?

			<h3>
				Origin
			</h3>
				<p>
					Karate developed on the Ryukyu Islands in what is now Okinawa, Japan. It was brought to the Japanese mainland in the early 20th century during a time of cultural exchanges between the Japanese and the Chinese. It was systematically taught in Japan after the Taisho era. After World War II, Okinawa became an important United States military site and karate became popular among servicemen stationed there.
				</p>
				<p>
					The word "karate" comes from a combination of two Japanese characters: "kara", which means "empty", and "te", which means "hand". So, "karate" means "empty hand". 
				</p>
				
			<h3>
				Shaolin Kempo Karate
			</h3>
				<p>
					There exist many different karate styles today; some traditional and some competitive. I've been learning a traditional style called Shaolin Kempo Karate. Founded by Frederick J. Villari, this form is a combination of the Five Animals of Shaolin Kung Fu, the core competency of Kempo, traditional Karate, as well as Western boxing and the arts of Jujutsu, Chin Na, and Mongolian wrestling.

			<h3>
				Why is Karate Important?
			</h3>
				<p>
				Despite being a way to defend yourself, karate affects both the mind and the body.
